## Author: Hammad Ullah

The following code shall dive deeper into the Polish market and analyze the jobs that are listed under the category of Business Intelligence and Big Data.This report is presented as a case study of a University looking to launch a new masters’ program under the name of “Business Engineering” where it hopes to make sure that the course content for this program prepares the students to prosper in the corporate world and have the right skills to be able to do well in their future endeavors related to their career. Moreover, the university would like to know other details regarding the jobs offered such as average salaries based on seniority of the job as well as the language requirement as many international students who enroll in the program would be looking forward to applying for jobs in the same Polish market.

**Conclusions**

This case study must be analyzed even deeper and further by checking more data as well in order to validate the findings. Nevertheless, we can still learn a lot from this research. Some take away points for the university are:

* Utmost priority should be teaching students the main software/skills that are required the most by the companies and also accompany them with the right mindset and approach to learn other skills by their own
* They must take the interests of international students into account by making sure they squeeze in 1 or 2 Polish language courses.
* The average salaries indicate that that this field is still well respected and paid which indirectly means that they should have little to no problem in finding students to enroll.
* University also needs to make a decision whether they want to launch Business Intelligence and Big Data as different departments or to merge them into one. This depends on many factors, but one to take into account from this research is that the university should merge the fields only if it believes that they can teach the students all the required skills of both departments in time. If that is not possible, then the university should stick to launching them as different departments.
